# === "core" directory ===
#
# This directory contains types that override various core types from QtQuick
# modules, such as QtQuick, Controls, Layouts, etc.
#
# These types provide tweaks and fixups that should be used throughout the
# application.  Tweaks contained here should be applicable in _virtually all_
# cases - if a particular tweak only applies "most of the time" or "some of the
# time", it probably belongs in "common" instead as a specifically named type.
#
# == Arabic / RTL ==
#
# These tweaks mainly pertain to layout fixups for Arabic (text alignment and
# RTL mirroring).  The intent is that most LTR/English layouts should mirror
# properly for Arabic by default, rather than resulting in a hodgepodge mess as
# is the normal default behavior for QtQuick.
#
# This means that for LTR/English, the tweaks applied generally should have no
# effect, so these are a drop-in replacement for the existing Qt types.
#
# = Text alignment =
#
# The "Text" type defaults to Left alignment instead of an alignment based on
# the text content.  (See Text.qml.)  The default behavior is unusable even
# without layout mirroring, because Text objects become a hodgepodged mess by
# default, since the effect of the automatic alignment depends on how the Text
# bounds are specified.  Layout mirroring mirrors this for RTL (if/when RTL is
# actually supported).
