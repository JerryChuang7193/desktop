# Building the WinTUN Installer

The Private Internet Access desktop client uses the [WinTUN](https://wintun.net) adapter from the WireGuard project.

Precompiled and signed versions of the WinTUN adapter installer are included in this repository, but you can check out and build the msi installer yourself from our [separate Git repository](https://github.com/pia-foss/desktop-wireguard).

See [build.txt](build.txt) for the commit ID used for the current precompiled binaries.
