# Building the Network Kernel Extension

To build the network kernel extension, check out our [separate Git repository](https://github.com/pia-foss/desktop-mac-network-kext).  Creating an installable kext build requires an Apple Developer ID with the kernel extension signing right.

We also include precompiled binaries in the main repository. This makes it a lot easier to quickly get started with development. See [build.txt](build.txt) for the commit ID used for the current precompiled binaries.
