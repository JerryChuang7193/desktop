# Building the WFP Callout Driver

To build the callout driver, check out our [separate Git repository](https://github.com/pia-foss/desktop-windows-wfp-callout).  Creating an installable driver build requires an EV code signing certificate.

We also include precompiled binaries in the main repository. This makes it a lot easier to quickly get started with development. See [build.txt](build.txt) for the commit ID used for the current precompiled binaries.
