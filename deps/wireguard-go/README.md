# Building the WireGuard user-space tunnel 

[`wireguard-go`](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/) is an implementation of the WireGuard(R) protocol written by Jason A. Donenfeld. 

It is used to set up a WireGuard(R) tunnel on macOS and Linux in user-space.

Precompiled versions of wireguard-go are included in this repository, but you can check out and rebuild them yourself from our [separate Git repository](https://github.com/pia-foss/desktop-wireguard).

See [build.txt](build.txt) for the commit ID used for the current precompiled binaries.
