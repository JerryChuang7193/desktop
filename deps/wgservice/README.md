# Building the WireGuard Windows Service

wgservice is an application used to set up and configure a WireGuard(R) tunnel. It is a windows executable intended to be installed and run as a Windows Service.

This is based on [embeddable-dll-service](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows/tree/embeddable-dll-service) from the WireGuard(R) project, written by Jason A. Donenfeld.

Precompiled versions of wgservice are included in this repository, but you can check out and rebuild them yourself from our [separate Git repository](https://github.com/pia-foss/desktop-wireguard).

See [build.txt](build.txt) for the commit ID used for the current precompiled binaries.
